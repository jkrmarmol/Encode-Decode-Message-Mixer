# Message Mixer

### Message Mixer Inc. offers a message-encryption service that transforms input text, using various ciphers, and displays the encrypted message to the console.


There are three encryption methods provided by this service:

1. A “Caesar Cipher” in which the characters of the input message are shifted alphabetically by a given amount.
2. A “Symbol Cipher” in which select characters from the input message are replaced with visually similar symbols.
3. A “Reverse Cipher” in which each word of the input message is reversed in place.

To use this service, run the command below:

    node message-mixer.js ['caesar'|'symbol'|'reverse'] [amount]

Here are some examples of running this program:

    $ node message-mixer.js caesar 4
    Enter the message you would like to encrypt...
    > hello world
    
    Here is your encrypted message:
    > lipps asvph
    
    $ node message-mixer.js 'reverse'
    Enter the message you would like to encrypt...
    > hello world
    
    Here is your encrypted message:
    > olleh dlrow
